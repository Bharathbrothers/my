Hello public!!!
Welcome to stark sources!
Competitive programming is mind sport.Competitive programming is in 
boom these days.Competitive programming is nothing but participating in coding challenges and competing with other candidates.Main purpose of Competitive programming:-
1.Gives pleasure while solving coding problems.Gains confidence in our selves.
2.Main importance is we can improve data structures and algorithms skill very rapidly if we plan correctly.
3.There is no need to prepare explicitly for interviews.Because in every product based companies mainly focus on individual's data structures and algorithms skill.
4.Perfect thing to do in Undergraduate life because of more time.
There are many websites to compete with others.some of platforms are:-
1.Codechef
2.Codeforces
3.Hackerrank
4.Hackerearth

Dont confuse with choosing platform.Rather focus on problem solving.
