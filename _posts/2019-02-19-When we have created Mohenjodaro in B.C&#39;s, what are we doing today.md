### When we have created Mohenjodaro in B.C&#39;s, what are we doing today? 

We had a well organized "SMART CITY" with well designed Housing system having Sanitation and Drinking water facilities in those days.  we had special ponds for Drinking water where anyone can use it for their purposes.  we also had a market system where people used to come to a common place to buy things from the sellers. But they used to exchange items instead of using money.  we can know all these facts from excavations by Archeologists. Thats the most advanced Civilization on this planet Earth. 
Today we the descendents of Harappans, are unable to have a proper Drainage System for each House. Government has taken many initiatives in this regard to help villages to have better Sanitation Facilities. Apart from these we also face Water Crisis today because,  we are unable to preserve Rain water properly but it was implemented properly in those days. They also constructed there houses with bricks which have uniform dimensions with atmost accuracy of cm.

From this we can understand how poor we are in facilities when compared to our ancestors.
