> MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

### Features:
- MongoDB **stores data** in flexible, ***JSON-like** documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time

- The document model **maps to the objects in your application code**, making data easy to work with

- **Indexing**, and **real time** aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data

- MongoDB is a **distributed database** at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use

- MongoDB is **free** and **open-source**.
