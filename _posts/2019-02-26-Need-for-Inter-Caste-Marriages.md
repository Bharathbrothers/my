It is one of the most important cases which came limelight

because of many events.  Let us start this story right from the beginning.

Earlier, the community was divided into various sections based on their profession i. e, the work they do for their living. The purpose of Introducing Caste System into the society is to differentiate one profession from another.

As time passed, this Discretion has been deep-rooted into society. From the  Last Century, it has lead to discrimination.  The lower Class working people are suppressed in all walks of their life.  But at some point, it should be stopped by one of the generations.

Let us be the Torchbearers to the upcoming generations where we will be as role models for them. we need to encourage a number of inter-caste marriages so that we don't have this discretion among us. From the few years, this has been implemented by a few people.  Now its high time for us to make it as a trend. One of the benefits we get that our next generations will be happier and healthier as a result of this.  I can justify this with an explanation where we had restricted marriages to within the caste which decreased our healthier rate and also caused many diseases. we can overcome this by following inter-caste marriages.
