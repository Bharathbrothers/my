## CS50

>Professor **David Malan** has been called one of the **world's better-known computer science educators**(probably the best..!).

This is CS50, **Harvard University's** introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. Social, but educational. A focused topic, but broadly applicable skills. CS50 is the quintessential Harvard (and Yale!) course.
