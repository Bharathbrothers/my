### Scratch

It is a block-based visual programming language(basic) which can learned easily by anyone to design simple games and applications. You can learn it
easily from the following two resources [Code.org](https://code.org/) and [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/index-2.html). 
Anyone irrespective of their age and domain can learn from these resources. These are used by kids of age [5-12] in various countries and we use 
it to build mobile applications easily with less code and complexity.

[Build Apps](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu)

Dont forget to play around with these tools, otherwise you will miss a lot(this is my opinion.!!).

Hope you will love this and can gift to newbies in Computer Science.
